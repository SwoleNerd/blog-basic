# blog-basic
A simple blogging web app built with PHP and MySQLi. The UI, created with Skeleton, is simple, yet aesthetic. 

Motivation: I created this app to practice using object oriented MySQLi. 

Installation: 

Future Dev: I intent to add a featured image, registration/login system, and text formatting. I'd also like to design a user friendly, WP-like install for the app.
